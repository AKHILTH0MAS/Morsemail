## Morse Mail
#### This is a simple project that i created as a task given from the company i'm taking internship. 
#### the idea is simple create a keyBoard to write mail for a paralysed person who can only click a mouse. While everyone created a keyboard that resembles the bios of system i thought i should make some thing diffrent hence i created this particular website. This is currently in development. Clearly it wasn't simple to create. We can take only a limited number of inputs.
